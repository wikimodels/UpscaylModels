                        <p><strong>The 4xLSDIRplusC model is an enhanced version of the 4xLSDIR model, designed to
                                provide better detail preservation during 4x upscaling:</strong></p>
                        <p>This model improves upon the original 4xLSDIR by incorporating additional capabilities that
                            allow it to handle more complex details in low-resolution images, making it suitable for a
                            wider range of image types.</p>
                        <p>The "plus" in the name suggests an improvement in its ability to preserve <strong>intricate
                                textures and patterns</strong>, especially when upscaling images that require
                            <strong>fine detail retention</strong>, such as architectural photographs, fabric close-ups,
                            or detailed artworks. It also minimizes blurriness and artifacts that could typically arise
                            from low-resolution sources.
                        </p>
                        <p>The "C" in the model name likely stands for a specific configuration or a
                            <strong>"compact"</strong> version of the original model, indicating a more optimized
                            version with similar or improved performance, while being more resource-efficient.
                        </p>
                        <p>This model is ideal for users looking to achieve <strong>high-quality upscaling</strong>
                            while maintaining the subtle details of low-resolution images. It strikes a balance between
                            <strong>performance and quality</strong>, especially useful for cases where preserving
                            delicate structures is crucial.
